# cmix

## my cmus configuration file

This only works with my fork of cmus
thats being developed (but works) right now

    git clone https://github.com/tonyfischetti/cmix.git ~/cmus

Don't forget to

    ln -s LOCATION_OF_MUSIC /home/tony/music

or whatever for the playlists to work

Oh, and don't forget to

    sudo apt build-dep cmus

before attempting to compile cmus fork
